[features]
# When this is active, the workarounds that keep C2Rust from generating extern
# types are disabled, and the library uses the nightly compiler feature
# `extern_types`.
keep-extern-types = []

# This prevents the `undef` of the dummy atomic definitions in
# `riot-c2rust.h` in case `stdatomic.h` is somewhere included.
# Note that these definitions are not realy atomics but placeholders.
# Thus a programm relying on the atomicity of the transpiled Rust structs
# will probably not work as intended.
dummy-atomic-definitions = []

# this needs to be set to build together with RIOT-rs.
