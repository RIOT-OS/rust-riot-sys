//! Replacements for [core::intrinsics] to work around <https://github.com/immunant/c2rust/issues/372>
//!
//! They are currently only define on riscv32; other platforms (or functions) can be added when
//! necessary. They can't be defined for all platforms, as Cortex-M0 don't have this operation.
//! (But then again, they're not needed, as theire RIOT C code can't contain these operations).
